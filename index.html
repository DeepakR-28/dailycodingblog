            Made up my mind decided to learn C++, went thru the basics again, and maybe trying out a very naive approach of doing c++ on Codeforce and python on codechef, so that the problems and difficulty do not meet at a junction, because I'm way better in python when compared to C++, so let us see how things turn out to be.

            Had a online meet with one of the best coders in the county, striver_79 if I'm not wrong, our college arranged a session with him to learn about competetive programming and all, got a few doubts cleard, but the problem in CP is that the more doubts that I get cleared the more keep on coming in my mind, had a FOMO because there were so many options to learn, decided to settle the timetable where I give some time to thing that I have to learn.

            Finally hosted this ugly thing your're seeing right now. Found this collapsing thing on w3Schools, felt it's cool, the css I gave is quite stinky. , also will find a better way to update progress rather than updating the github repo daily. seri bye
