  Monday <br>
  oof, Had a Technical Interview Today, 4 questions were asked, 3 were kinda easy, passed all test cases for just one, meh.. I'm not sad about what my result is gonna be, I'm happy for those who'll clear it, but sad about a realization, a doubt that has resided in my mind, that if I have a crab mentality, which is making me think a lot, but then talked with a friend in the evening  and things were normal then, but still thinking about do I???

Saturday <br>
  College arranged a Data structure bootcamp, I was excited for it, as I decided to learn it in April but just couldn't do it, maybe didn't get the right mentor or motiavation to do it. Within the first 10 minutes of the class I realised that all that I have been doing in the past 5 months was just coding Naive solutions, and a very laggy code that was good enough to pass the test cases. It was kind of an eye opening session, my data strucure and Algorithms faculty never insited us to learn it, all she kept on saying was pass the subject, and we just studied it a few days before the exam, it is sad man, we are equally to be blamed for it. Anyway, I somehow fing a path to walk on, let's see how far I reach.

  Started with C++, functions and all, for loop sab. Made a Telegram group where we friends could ask coding doubts, let's see how that turns out to be, I have had decent ideas on improvement but the implimentation has always been pathetic. A friend asked if we could code together, we decided a time, and I planned my day around that session, but now he didn't even join and i am writing this blog because I don't feel like doing anything.

            Made up my mind decided to learn C++, went thru the basics again, and maybe trying out a very naive approach of doing c++ on Codeforce and python on codechef, so that the problems and difficulty do not meet at a junction, because I'm way better in python when compared to C++, so let us see how things turn out to be.

            Had a online meet with one of the best coders in the county, striver_79 if I'm not wrong, our college arranged a session with him to learn about competetive programming and all, got a few doubts cleard, but the problem in CP is that the more doubts that I get cleared the more keep on coming in my mind, had a FOMO because there were so many options to learn, decided to settle the timetable where I give some time to thing that I have to learn.

            Finally hosted this ugly thing your're seeing right now. Found this collapsing thing on w3Schools, felt it's cool, the css I gave is quite stinky. , also will find a better way to update progress rather than updating the github repo daily. seri bye
