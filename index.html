Wednesday<br>
   Forked a new repo, where I have to give solution for Bubble sort in 4 languages, once done, it'll be 3 PR for Hacktoberfest, also saw a lot of people just changing text to successfully make a PR, there was rage among developers on twitter calling it a spam and asked Hactoberfest and Github to take this seriously. Things we all do for schwags.

Wednesday<br>
   It is day 47 and 6 months have passed in this lockdown, thinking of starting with DS from the begenning of April and by the end of september I have finally started something in it. Not a bad way to end this month,could have been worse, anyhow, will just hope for the best from here, doing 3 leetcode problems everyday. and hope to increse it gradually, also Came to know about pushing to github directly from repl.it. life has become easier.

   Showcased the portfolio that I completed on Day 43 . got a decent response, continued with the ML class then, I have 0% intrest in machine learning, i just feel like punching anyone who comes to me and talks about it, it is intresting but not intrested for now.

Monday<br>
   Woke up late, didn't feel like attending the first class, came across a cool doodling platform sketch.io , Did 3 leetcode easy problems, Leetcode is the OG site for learning optimized algorithms. Now I realised why people recommend it. <br> 
      People who haven't started with leetcode will probably start after seeing <a href = "https://ibb.co/KD1v99F" style = "color: red" >this image.</a> Best and it is better late than never to realise something.

  Had a data structure class yesterday, learnt stack and got a better idea about time and space complexity, played some chess and was fun, some funny moments happend, wrote a blog about it <a href = "https://www.phoblo.co.in/2020/09/noob-plays-chess.html" style ="color :yellow;"> Here. </a> <br> Today's DS class was cancelled because they thought we are not interacting enough. started leetcode, did a problem to get familiar, was a sunday so felt lazy to do anything, a guy defeated me in chess after just 8 moves. went to sleep.

  Learnt flex box for the project section layout in the portfolio, implemented, then went to sleep, one more Intresting thing happenend, I felt a smooth scroll would be a tough thing to implement, and then later checked that there is a built in method for that in css, I thought it would be rather a very tough thing to implement. Turned out if we search a bit it becomes easy

 Many bugs are present in the code, have to tacle them, but busy until 10th, so will probably do it on the night of 10th. It was a hard time explaining people the code. I don't know why it was so tough to understand, mostly because of small bugs but anyway, will have to take care of them.

  Went to play badminton, came home early thinking I'll be late for the class, waited around 20 mins for someone to join and then later realised it was Onam, sooooo yeah that's that. <br> did some internship work listened to the Harsha Bhogle podcast with Sorabh Pant where Harsha said somehting Intresting, People who we thinkg know everything is because they choose to say the things they know about and don't blabber, so if you talk about things you know people might end up being intimidated. which was quite intresting when I sat and thought about it. <br>
  Did 2016 kickstart problem, result was WA but meh.. was fine with it, used dictionary which I don't usually. so was happy with it.

  Haaaaaaaaaaaaa, finally a weekend, woke up and solved problems in Guvi after a month or so, was able to solve which I didn't understand months ago, soooo... yeah nice, also a data structure bootcamp started, had a nice 3 hour long class in the evening, Was great except them asking us to ask doubts even tho we were clear with what ever he taught, the guy literally wanted us to get doubts from thin air. Give us time to go thru it, we will come up with doubts, don't stress on us to ask doubts. other than that, nothing else. Understood Time and space complexity till an extent.

Saturday <br>
  College arranged a Data structure bootcamp, I was excited for it, as I decided to learn it in April but just couldn't do it, maybe didn't get the right mentor or motiavation to do it. Within the first 10 minutes of the class I realised that all that I have been doing in the past 5 months was just coding Naive solutions, and a very laggy code that was good enough to pass the test cases. It was kind of an eye opening session, my data strucure and Algorithms faculty never insited us to learn it, all she kept on saying was pass the subject, and we just studied it a few days before the exam, it is sad man, we are equally to be blamed for it. Anyway, I somehow fing a path to walk on, let's see how far I reach.

  Started with C++, functions and all, for loop sab. Made a Telegram group where we friends could ask coding doubts, let's see how that turns out to be, I have had decent ideas on improvement but the implimentation has always been pathetic. A friend asked if we could code together, we decided a time, and I planned my day around that session, but now he didn't even join and i am writing this blog because I don't feel like doing anything.

            Made up my mind decided to learn C++, went thru the basics again, and maybe trying out a very naive approach of doing c++ on Codeforce and python on codechef, so that the problems and difficulty do not meet at a junction, because I'm way better in python when compared to C++, so let us see how things turn out to be.
